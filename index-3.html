            Blockchain establishes trust between parties without third-party verification. In 2024, blockchain has the potential to transform payments through cryptocurrencies as well as enhance transparency in supply chains, contracts, and certificates. Countries are also exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) built on blockchain technology. 

            However, mainstream blockchain adoption still faces regulatory uncertainty, concerns around energy consumption, and issues scaling to transaction volumes required for large-scale finance and banking applications. Gradual progress is expected rather than overnight transformation.
